#### My name is **Mayank Gupta ðŸš€**. I'm a 25-year-old, full-stack software engineer. Passionate about helping organisations solve their large-scale, distributed technical problems.

I prefer to write **back-end** code, but I can do the front-end if needed.  
**Python, JavaScript, Golang** is my programming language of choice.

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: **bong_o_hari** is my default username for all social media
- âš¡ Fun fact: When not brainstorming at work, I love a cup of Ginger Tea on a rainy evening, and cooking some delicacies. If you love to eat, we can be friends.
